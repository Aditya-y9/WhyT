## 📝Description
Our project is a comprehensive tool designed to benefit a wide range of users, including students, analysts, and anyone seeking efficient information retrieval. We have developed a YouTube video summarizer coupled with an important slides generator, packaged in the form of PDFs.

1. This feature enables users to extract key points and summaries from YouTube videos. It condenses lengthy videos into concise and easily digestible summaries.

2.Our tool automatically identifies significant slides within a presentation or lecture video. It extracts these slides and compiles them into a PDF document for easy reference.

3.Our integrated chatbot allows users to interact with the video content through questions and answers.Users can ask questions related to the video and receive responses based on the content discussed.
